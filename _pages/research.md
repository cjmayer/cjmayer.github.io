  ### Language Documentation and Revitalization of the Woleaian language

Since 2021, I have been working with the Woleaian-speaking community, both in Hawaiʻi and in Yap State on documenting their language and culture. Woleaian is a Micronesian language spoken on 7 small coral atolls in the Outer Islands of Yap State, Federated States of Micronesia (FSM), as well as in the diaspora in Guam, Hawaiʻi and the continental United States. Speaker estimates vary, but the community estimates around 2,000 Woleaian-speakers globally. The main community I have been working with is that of Eauripik atoll, the smallest of the seven, with about 70-90 inhabitants, but larger populations on Yap Main Island. A village, Gargey, on Yap Main Island was my main field site for two fieldwork trips in early 2023, and serves as a continued touchstone whenever I visit Yap for fieldwork.
The Woleaian-speaking community has noticed a decline in the continued use and remembrance of traditional Woleaian oral and physical culture.
