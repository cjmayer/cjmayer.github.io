Hello! Hallo! Aloha mai! Welimmwemi! I am a PhD candidate at the <a href="http://ling.hawaii.edu/" target="_blank">linguistics department</a> of the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa specializing in the documentation and revitalization of Micronesian languages, specifically Woleaian. Woleaian is a language originally spoken on the outer islands of Yap State in the Federated States of Micronesia, but not also has sizeable populations on Yap's main island, as well as Guam, Hawaiʻi and the continental United States, with an estimated 2,000 speakers total. My research focuses on community-based language documentation and revitalization, descriptive linguistics, typology, and historical linguistics, as well as language and culture revitalization in the Woleaian-speaking diaspora.
